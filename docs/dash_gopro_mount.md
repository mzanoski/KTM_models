# GoPro Mount
This is a simple mount that is designed to work with the [accessory bar](dash_accessory_bar.md).  If using default accessory bar values, you can use default mount parameter values as well.

## Definitions
This scad file uses the same parameter pattern as the accessory bar file.  It's important to understand that __BAR_Diameter__, __BAR_ToothDepth__, and __BAR_NumberOfTeeth__ values must match exactly the values used for the accessory bar in order to fit with each other.
